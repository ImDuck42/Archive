Stress is a common part of student life, but there are ways to manage it.
Start by planning and prioritizing your tasks by breaking them into smaller steps. Don’t forget to take regular breaks to stay fresh. Exercise, whether it’s a walk or a quick workout, is a great way to clear your mind. Practicing mindfulness, even just a few minutes of deep breathing, can help calm you down.

Sleep is important—7-8 hours will keep you sharp, so don’t sacrifice it. Talking to someone, whether a friend or teacher, can give you new perspectives and ease your worries. Eating a balanced diet is another simple way to manage stress, as it keeps your energy steady. Set realistic goals so you don’t overwhelm yourself, and always make time for hobbies to relax.

And if all else fails, breaking something might give you a little relief. Just be careful not to go overboard!
